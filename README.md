To run the game, simply run the source code. No external imports are needed, as all imports used in the game are built-ins.
It is highly recommended to run the code in a terminal of your choice, as this is a terminal-based game.

Upon starting the game, you are prompted with a choice of 2 gamemodes, Creative and Survival, as well as an exit choice.
To proceed, you need only enter a "1" for Creative, and "2" for Survival.s
